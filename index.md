# 2018 - 2022 - PhD

I did my PhD at [UFMG](https://ufmg.br/), with the [LACSED](https://lacsed.eng.ufmg.br/) group. [Professor Patr√≠cia](https://somos.ufmg.br/professor/patricia-nascimento-pena) and [Professor Karen](https://smithengineering.queensu.ca/directory/faculty/karen-rudie) were my advisors.

My research during the PhD can be divided in two phases. 

## Phase 1

Inspired by the work of [Wakaiki et al](papers/others/Wakaiki2019_Article_SupervisoryControlOfDiscrete_E.pdf), we came up with a new way to represent and how to obtain pairs of indistinguishable states due to the action of the attacker.
	2) This new phase started when I decided to take a closer look into real systems and how they are implemented and how results and methods presented on the literature would apply in a real system. I noticed a gap between whats is considered in the DES community and what is considered in the literature on cyber-attacks in general. Additionally, a felt the need to be able to test the results in a real physical system.
