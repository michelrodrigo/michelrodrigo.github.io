This is my timeline. 


# 2018 - 2022 - PhD

I did my PhD at [UFMG](https://ufmg.br/), with the [LACSED](https://lacsed.eng.ufmg.br/) group. [Professor Patrícia](https://somos.ufmg.br/professor/patricia-nascimento-pena) and [Professor Karen](https://smithengineering.queensu.ca/directory/faculty/karen-rudie) were my advisors.

My research during the PhD can be divided in two phases. All the results are presented in my [thesis](papers/mine/thesis_Michel_final_version.pdf). 

## Phase 1

Inspired by the work of [Wakaiki et al. (2019)](papers/others/Wakaiki2019_Article_SupervisoryControlOfDiscrete_E.pdf), where a property called P-observability for an attack set was defined, we came up with a new way to test it. The test was based on a new way of representing pairs of indistinguishable states. In this context, a pair of states can become indistinguishable due to the action of an attacker. From this work, we published two papers, one in SBAI 2021 and the other one at JDEDS:
- [Unknown Sensor Attacks in Supervisory Control of DES (2021)](papers/mine/Alves_Pena_Karen_Rudie___2021___Unknown_Sensor_Attacks_in_Supervisory_Control_of_DES.pdf)
- [Discrete-event systems subject to unknown sensor attacks (2022)](papers/mine/Alves_Pena_Rudie___2022___Discrete_event_systems_subject_to_unknown_sensor_attacks.pdf)

## Phase 2

This new phase started when I decided to take a closer look into real systems and their implementation. Furthermore, I was interested on how results and methods related to cyber-security presented on the literature would apply in a real system. I noticed a gap between what is considered in the DES community and what is considered in the literature on cyber-security in general. Additionally, a felt the need to be able to test the results in a real physical system. 

However, because of the COVID 19 pandemics, I was stuck at home at this time and I had to built the physical system myself. I did it using arduino and other low-cost devices. We published a paper at [WODES 2022](https://wodes2022.ciirc.cvut.cz/) describing the system, as well as a repository to share information about it.

## Other activities

During this time, I was also doing another activities:
- Personal tutor (math, physics, electronicis and programming)
- Game developper: [Frog Around](https://github.com/michelrodrigo/frogAround). Don't get too excited, it was a simple little game written in python. 
- Intership at [Fundação João Pinheiro](https://fjp.mg.gov.br/), where I worked in a [digital transformation project with R](https://github.com/FundacaoJoaoPinheiro/R/tree/main)
- Teacher at [CEFET-MG](https://www.cefetmg.br/), where I taught automation, electronics, electrical projects and programming courses at technician level
- Teacher at SENAI-MG, where I taught automation, process control and instrumentation courses at technician level
- Volunteer teacher at the Department of Electronics Engineering, where I taught the control lab course.
