# 2018 - 2022 - PhD

I did my PhD at [UFMG](https://ufmg.br/), with the [LACSED](https://lacsed.eng.ufmg.br/) group. [Professor Patr√≠cia](https://somos.ufmg.br/professor/patricia-nascimento-pena) and [Professor Karen](https://smithengineering.queensu.ca/directory/faculty/karen-rudie) were my advisors.

My research during the PhD can be divided in two phases. 

## Phase 1

Inspired by the work of [Wakaiki et al. (2019)](papers/others/Wakaiki2019_Article_SupervisoryControlOfDiscrete_E.pdf), where a property called P-observability for an attack set was defined, we came up with a new way to test it. The test was based on a new way of representing pairs of indistinguishable states. In this context, a pair of states can become indistinguishable due to the action of an attacker. From this work, we published two papers, one in SBAI 2021 and the other one at JDEDS:
- [Unknown Sensor Attacks in Supervisory Control of DES (2021)](papers/mine/Alves_Pena_Karen_Rudie___2021___Unknown_Sensor_Attacks_in_Supervisory_Control_of_DES.pdf)
- [Discrete-event systems subject to unknown sensor attacks (2022)](papers/mine/Alves_Pena_Rudie___2022___Discrete_event_systems_subject_to_unknown_sensor_attacks.pdf)

## Phase 2

This new phase started when I decided to take a closer look into real systems and their implementation. Furthermore, I was interested on how results and methods related to cyber-security presented on the literature would apply in a real system. I noticed a gap between what is considered in the DES community and what is considered in the literature on cyber-security in general. Additionally, a felt the need to be able to test the results in a real physical system.
